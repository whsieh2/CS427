Q2. For each team member, including yourself, answer the following questions:
    (For more detailed behavioral description, please see the CATME calibration.)
===========================================================================
* Is the member contributing to the team's work?

  not contributing  <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  contributing
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ** Reference behavior for average score, which is (3):
     - Completes a fair share of the team's work with acceptable quality.
     - Keeps commitments and completes assignments on time.
     - Helps teammates who are having difficulty when it is easy or important.

(5) - tunnell2

  ** WHY do you think so? Illustrate with examples.
Only two of the members are performing subpar. The rest are contributing and easy to work with (they reply fast and are flexible with their schedules to work).
One of the members has contributed more and plays a major role in organizing the group.

==============================================================================
* Does the member have good interactions with the teammates?

  poor interaction   <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  good interaction
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ** Reference behavior for average score, which is (3):
     - Listens to teammates and respects their contributions.
     - Communicates clearly. Shares information with teammates.
     - Participates fully in team activities.
     - Respects and responds to feedback from teammates.

  ** WHY do you think so? Illustrate with examples.
Everyone is responsive for the major meet ups. There have been some problems with a few pairs, but nothing too serious. 
We all do a good job of communicating and helping each other. We all talk to make sure we're on the same page.

==============================================================================
* Is the member keeping the team on track?

       not keeping    <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  keeping
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ** Reference behavior for average score, which is (3):
     - Notices changes that influence the team's success.
     - Knows what everyone on the team should be doing and notices problems.
     - Alerts teammates or suggests solutions when the team's success is threatened.

  ** WHY do you think so? Illustrate with examples.
Some members are a little quiet and will occassionally contribute. We all are contributing to figuring out the best dynamic to 
work most efficiently.

==============================================================================
* Is the member expecting quality work from the team?

      not expecting   <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  expecting
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ** Reference behavior for average score, which is (3):
     - Encourages the team to do good work that meets all requirements.
     - Wants the team to perform well enough to earn all available rewards.
     - Believes that the team can fully meet its responsibilities.

  ** WHY do you think so? Illustrate with examples.
We all believed we could finish our portions. It was unfortunate that this was not the case. We are constantly reminding each other of specific criteria
and strive to do the best. There have been some speed bumps. We are working and talking to smooth out the path.

==============================================================================
* Does the member have related knowledge, skills, and abilities?

       not having     <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  having
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ** Reference behavior for average score, which is (3):
     - Demonstrates sufficient knowledge, skills, and abilities to contribute to the team's work.
     - Acquires knowledge or skills as needed to meet requirements.
     - Able to perform some of the tasks normally done by other team members.

  ** WHY do you think so? Illustrate with examples.
Only one pair was able to complete their tasks. The other groups all had incomplete products. It was due to not completely understanding Jelly.

Q3. Team and CATME
==============================================================================
* Are you satisfied with your present teammates?

       not satisfied  <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  satisfied
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) - I rate my OWN satisfaction with this score.
I find that we are a little dysfunctional at the momemnt. A few do not contribute much and are sometimes unresponsive to text or emails. 
A majority are competent and able to work well. But, for the iteration we all worked as separate parts and did not do a good job of integrating our parts
into one product. We all know, and we are meeting and discussing to fix this issue. We will create a stricter schedule.
==============================================================================
* What do you see as the strengths of using CATME to form teams? Please explain WHY.
I believe it makes a random enviroment, much like the real work force. There will be many different types of people put on a team and forced to
coordinate. Each member of the team should be conscious of their role and strive for the same goal. I think CATME tries to simulate this kind of 
enviroment. 
==============================================================================
* What do you see as the weaknesses of using CATME to form teams? Please explain WHY.
I think the schedule system was flawed. When I checked when everyone was free, many of the time slots were incorrect from my actual schedule.

==============================================================================
* Do you recommend using CATME in future courses?

  strongly NOT recommend  <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  strongly recommend
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) - I rate my OWN recommendation with this score.

  ** WHY? If you prefer another method (e.g., self-formed teams or random), describe.
  
 I enjoy the consistency of working with people you are familiar with. However, I also understand the prospect of working with random people because it teaches 
 how to work in a team and figure out specific dynamics.
