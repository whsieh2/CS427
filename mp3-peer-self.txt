Comments:
We worked off of his VM/computer. We'd both take turns being the driver and helper. He'd drive one implementation, then I would drive for the test function. Then we would switch off. Very helpful for the coding part because something he would know and something I would know how to do. Made it very easy to collaborate. I did apologize to him because reaching me at first was difficult, but we were able to move past it and successfully completed the MP over the weekend.
