  ** WHY do you think so? Illustrate with examples.
Team does a good job of doing their portions of the code. Only two seem quiet most of the time and not adding much to the work done. 
We had some issues with commits that did not compile. After feedback, teammates followed correct commit procedures.

  ** WHY do you think so? Illustrate with examples.
Most are very good coders and team members. We are all able to fill in the spots of knowledge when needed. Or help learn together to fix problems as a team. Most members were able to 
understand other storyboards because they contributed.

Q3. Team and CATME
==============================================================================
* Are you satisfied with your present teammates?

       not satisfied  <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  satisfied
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) - I rate my OWN satisfaction with this score.

==============================================================================
* What do you see as the strengths of using CATME to form teams? Please explain WHY.

The objectivism of schedules lining up and percieved characteristics of each member. There is randomness because no one has a clue who they will be matched with.

==============================================================================
* What do you see as the weaknesses of using CATME to form teams? Please explain WHY.
Because you can't select people you already know, who may be competent workers, you can end up with incompetent team members.

==============================================================================
* Do you recommend using CATME in future courses?

  strongly NOT recommend  <<< (1) << (2) << (3) >> (4) >> (5) >>>  strongly recommend
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) - I rate my OWN recommendation with this score.

  ** WHY? If you prefer another method (e.g., self-formed teams or random), describe.
   I enjoy the consistency of working with people you are familiar with. However, I also understand the prospect of working with random people because it teaches 
 how to work in a team and figure out specific dynamics.
 I enjoy picking my own team members.
